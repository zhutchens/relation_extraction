Metric: Answer Correctness
Testing: Topics
Score: 0.2
Reason: The actual output includes some relevant topics like Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, and Hash Maps, but misses many others such as Collections, Abstract Data Types, and Unit Testing from the expected output.
Actual: ['Data Structures', 'Algorithms', 'Linked Lists', 'Stacks', 'Queues', 'Generic Lists', 'Hash Maps', 'Trees', 'Graphs', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Big-O Complexity', 'Recursion', 'Sorting', 'Searching']
Expected: ['Collections, Abstract Data Types, Interfaces, Generics', 'Unit Testing, Exception Handling, JavaDoc', 'Big O Notation & Analysis', 'Arrays & ArrayLists', 'Stacks & Queues', 'Comparing, Sorting & Searching', 'Linked Nodes and Linked Structures', 'Lists', 'Recursion & Recursive Searching & SortingTrees & Heaps', 'Graphs', 'Hash Functions, Hash Tables, and Hash Maps']

Reason: The actual output includes an additional point about using built-in data structures in an object-oriented programming language, which is not in the expected output. Otherwise, the content aligns well with the expected output.
Actual: ['Use built-in data structures in an object-oriented programming language', 'Compare and analyze basic building blocks of data structures, arrays, ArrayList, and linked lists', 'Implement data structures (such as stacks, queues, generic lists, trees, hash maps, and graphs) based on an ADT, using arrays, ArrayList, or linked nodes, as appropriate', 'Choose an appropriate data structure for a given problem/situation (such as stacks, queues, generic lists, trees, hash maps, graphs)', 'Apply data structures (such as stacks, queues, generic lists, trees, hash maps, and graphs) to solve a given problem', 'Use generics to ensure appropriate generalization of code', 'Analyze the Big-O complexity of an algorithm or function', 'Write and execute test cases for a class', 'Trace and analyze recursive algorithms']
